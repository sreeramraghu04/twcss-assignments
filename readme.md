# TailwindCSS Assignment

Tailwind CSS assignments typically involve practical tasks that help you learn and apply Tailwind’s utility-first approach. Here are some common types of assignments with a short description:

### 1. **Basic Styling**

- Use Tailwind classes to style buttons, text, backgrounds, and spacing.
- Example: Create a button with hover and active states using Tailwind utilities.

### 2. **Responsive Design**

- Apply Tailwind’s responsive classes (`sm:`, `md:`, `lg:`) to build layouts that adapt to different screen sizes.
- Example: Design a simple navbar that turns into a hamburger menu on mobile.

### 3. **Component Building**

- Create reusable UI components like cards, modals, and forms using Tailwind utilities.
- Example: Build a product card with an image, title, price, and add-to-cart button.

### 4. **Layouts & Grid Systems**

- Use Tailwind’s `flexbox` and `grid` utilities to create different layouts.
- Example: Design a three-column blog layout that stacks on smaller screens.

### 5. **Dark Mode Implementation**

- Utilize Tailwind’s `dark:` variant to enable dark mode in a project.
- Example: Create a profile card that switches between light and dark mode.

### 6. **Animations & Transitions**

- Use Tailwind’s `animate-` and `transition-` utilities for smooth animations.
- Example: Create a button that scales up slightly on hover.

### 7. **Form Styling**

- Apply the `@tailwindcss/forms` plugin and customize input fields, checkboxes, and radio buttons.
- Example: Design a login form with styled inputs and a submit button.

### 8. **Typography and Content Styling**

- Utilize the `@tailwindcss/typography` plugin to format text-heavy content.
- Example: Style a blog post with headings, paragraphs, and blockquotes.

### 9. **Navigation Menus**

- Build dynamic navigation menus using Tailwind’s `flex`, `gap`, and `hidden` utilities.
- Example: Create a dropdown menu that appears on hover.

### 10. **Customizing Tailwind Config**
